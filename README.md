My-Bio
======

This project is My personal homepage which is a simple HTML page. (www4.ncsu.edu/~rkandha)

I use it to test basic CSS stuff and on-going BootStrap learning. It is hosted on server which unfortunately don't
support JavaScript that's why no funny, crazy stuff.

But I believe BootStrap can definitely improve it.
